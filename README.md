Software Development Methods and Tools
Introduces the basics of large-scale software development. As software size increases, so does the need to use appropriate tools and development techniques. The phases of traditional software development and several current software development lifecycles are introduced. The use of object- oriented techniques for large projects is covered. Creating appropriate and sufficient tests for test-driven and behavior-driven development is discussed.

-Select an appropriate software development lifecycle for a project.
-Compare the various agile software development lifecycles.
-Evaluate different object-oriented techniques for problem solving.
-Construct a testing environment that includes code coverage analysis.
-Collect and analyze both static and dynamic properties for a program.
-Organize a project group with appropriate roles for members.
-Compare and contrast several software architectures.
